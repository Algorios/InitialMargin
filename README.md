# InitialMargin

This library is a C# implementation of the [Standard Initial Margin Model 2.1 (SIMM™ 2.1)](https://www.isda.org/2018/08/27/isda-publishes-isda-simm-2-1/) developed by [ISDA](https://www.isda.org), built to be compatible with the [Common Risk Interchange Format (CRIF™)](https://www.isda.org/a/owEDE/risk-data-standards-v1-36-public.pdf). It's easy to deploy, easy to maintain (periodic updates to the model can be integrated effortlessly) and stable.
